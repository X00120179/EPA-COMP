# EPA-COMP

# Week 1 was an introductory week so no labs.
# Week 2 was only our first week and had no lab to be uploaded to Github.
# Week 3 we had a lab but I pushed to Github a week after everyone else.
# Week 4 we had a CA so no lab to push to Github.
# Week 5 we connected to the AWS command line interface to work with amazon instances.
